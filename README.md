This project predicts employee productivity based on a machine learning model. The dataset contains several features like Age, Number of Projects Completed, Satisfaction Rate, Feedback Score, and Salary. The machine learning model is trained to predict the Productivity (%) of an individual from these parameters.

Besides, a FastAPI app is created to serve the trained model as an API endpoint able to predict productivity for new data points.
